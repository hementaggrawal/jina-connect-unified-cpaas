"""Resolve-or-create WaConversation for inbound messages (#189).

Single entry point for every WA inbound-handler that needs a
conversation FK. Reuses an existing open conversation if the contact
sent something within the last 24h on the same WA app; otherwise
spawns a fresh row (closing the previous one if it expired).

This is the only place we encode the per-conversation 24h
service-window semantics; flow runtime, CTWA ingestion, and the
inbox-grouping query all read state off the returned conversation.
