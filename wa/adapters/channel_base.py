"""
BaseChannelAdapter — Abstract interface for all messaging channels.

Every channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.) must provide an adapter that
implements this interface. The channel registry resolves the correct adapter
at runtime via ``get_channel_adapter(platform, tenant)``.

Architecture:
    get_channel_adapter("TELEGRAM", tenant)
        └── TelegramAdapter(BaseChannelAdapter)
                └── TelegramBotClient (HTTP)

    get_channel_adapter("WHATSAPP", tenant)
        └── BaseBSPAdapter(BaseChannelAdapter)
                └── MetaDirectAdapter | GupshupAdapter

Capability declarations:
    Each adapter declares its ``platform`` and ``capabilities`` so callers can
    introspect what the channel supports before invoking a method. See
    ``Capabilities`` below.
