def reconcile_orphans(batch_size: int = 200) -> dict:
    """Walk ``CtwaLead`` rows with ``flagged_orphan_campaign=True`` and
    attempt to resolve them to a local ``CtwaCampaign``.

    Resolution strategies (in order):

      1. Re-check whether a local campaign with matching ``meta_ad_id``
         appeared since the lead was created (the publish-webhook race).
      2. Call Meta Marketing API for the ad id across the tenant's
         connected ad accounts; on hit, create a shadow campaign
         (``status='external'``) and link.
      3. If neither resolves, leave flagged for tenant review.

    Strategy 2 needs ``meta/`` OAuth tokens and ``ads/`` Marketing API
    client — both shipped in this PR but the live API call is stubbed
    until #190 (Meta app review) approves the relevant scopes. For now
    only strategy 1 actually resolves orphans.

    Scheduled via Celery beat — weekly cadence.
