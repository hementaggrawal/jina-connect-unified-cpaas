"""CTWA inbound-referral handler (#194).

Called from ``wa/tasks.py`` after the WA inbound message has been
parsed and the ``WaConversation`` resolved. Creates the ``CtwaLead``
row, links it to the conversation, and on terminal status transitions
also drives the ``attribution/`` CAPI push (via the standard
``CtwaLead.post_save`` signal handler that #197 wires in).

Orphan handling: if ``referral.source_id`` doesn't match any local
``CtwaCampaign.meta_ad_id``, we still create the lead with
``flagged_orphan_campaign=True``. Reasons:

  * Paused / archived ads stay in feed caches for hours.
  * Tenants run ads outside Jina Connect (manual Ads Manager use).
  * Meta ad IDs occasionally arrive before our publish webhook does.

The weekly reconciliation worker (``ctwa.tasks.reconcile_orphans``)
walks orphans and links them via shadow ``CtwaCampaign(status=external)``
rows when the ad id is found on the tenant's connected ad accounts.
